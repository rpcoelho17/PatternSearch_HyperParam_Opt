# Pattern Search Hyperparameter Optimization
Hyperparameter Optimization inspired my MATLAB's global optimization pattern search algorythm. This python notebook contains some research I did on using Pattern Search to find the best hyperparameters for a machine learning algorythm.  The tecnique looks promething finding a better value with less function evaluations than scikit-opt Baysian Optimization and SKLearn Random search.

I also implemented sklearn's feature selector which automatically picks the most relevant features from a dataset.
